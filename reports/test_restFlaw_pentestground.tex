\section{Summary of Main Information Discovered and Tasks Performed}

Based on the terminal input and output from the reconnaissance phase using Dirb on the target \url{https://pentest-ground.com:9000}, here is a summary of the main information discovered and tasks performed:

\subsection{Directory/File Discovery}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Several directories and files were discovered, including:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item /assets
        \item /css
        \item /fonts
        \item /images
        \item /index.html
        \item /js
        \item /login
        \item /register
        \item /server-status (403 Forbidden)
    \end{itemize}
    \item These discoveries helped identify potential attack surfaces, such as login and registration pages.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{HTTP Response Codes}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The scan returned various HTTP response codes, including:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item 200 OK: /assets, /css, /fonts, /images, /index.html, /js, /login, /register
        \item 403 Forbidden: /server-status
    \end{itemize}
    \item These codes provided insight into accessible and restricted resources on the target web server.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Web Server Identification}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The web server was identified as "nginx/1.14.0 (Ubuntu)".
    \item Knowing the web server software can help in identifying potential vulnerabilities and tailoring exploitation techniques.
\end{itemize}

\section{Further Testing}

Based on this information, further testing can be conducted to identify potential vulnerabilities and exploit them. Be sure to follow ethical guidelines and obtain proper authorization before proceeding with any exploitation attempts.
